We believe that, especially when building agents that affectively interact with biological humans in real-time, a cognitive science-based, multilayered sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach is needed. For this demo, we show a working version (through human interaction with it) our modular system of natural, conversation 3D virtual human using AI or sensing layers. These including sensing the human user via facial emotion recognition, voice stress, semantic meaning of the words, eye gaze, heart rate, and galvanic skin response. These inputs are combined with AI sensing and recognition of the environment using deep learning natural language captioning or dense captioning. These are all processed by our AI avatar system allowing for an affective and empathetic conversation using an NLP topic-based dialogue capable of using facial expressions, gestures, breath, eye gaze and voice language-based two-way back and forth conversations with a sensed human. Our lab has been building these systems in stages over the years.","tags":["Empathy","Affective computing","Evaluation","Virtual agents"],"title":"A multi-layer artificial intelligence and sensing based affective conversational embodied agent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ÖN Yalcin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561964400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561964400,"objectID":"07aa1958bc7e35d2f64f1c658aaaaf1e","permalink":"/publication/acii2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acii2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Empathy is a complex socio-emotional behavior that results from the interaction between affective and cognitive mechanisms.

It provides a way to increase our understanding of the link between affective and cognitive processes and enhance our interaction with artificial agents. However, the variety of fields contributing to empathy research has resulted in isolated approaches to modeling empathy, and this has led to various definitions of empathy and an absence of common ground regarding underlying empathic processes. Although this diversity may be useful in that it allows for an in-depth examination of various processes linked to empathy, it also may not yet provide a coherent theoretical picture of empathy. We argue that a clear theoretical positioning is required for collective progress. The aim of this article is, therefore, to call for a holistic and multilayered view of a model of empathy, taken from the rich background research from various disciplines. To achieve this, we present a comprehensive background on the theoretical foundations, followed by the working definitions, components, and models of empathy that are proposed by various fields. Following this introduction, we provide a detailed review of the existing techniques used in AI research to model empathy in interactive agents, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We conclude with a discussion of future directions in this emerging field.","tags":["Empathy","Affective computing","Evaluation","Virtual agents","empathy models","computational modeling","survey"],"title":"Modeling empathy: building a link between affective and cognitive processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ÖN Yalcin","S DiPaola"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530428400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530428400,"objectID":"91c8cd3ac1ffb1cc200b31d6b10bc8b8","permalink":"/publication/bica2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bica2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Empathy has been defined in the scientific literature as the capacity to relate another’s emotional state and assigned to a broad spectrum of cognitive and behavioral abilities.

A computational model of empathy not only would help to advance the technological artifacts to be more socially compatible, but also understand the empathy mechanisms, test theories, and address the ethics and morality problems the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community is facing today.
